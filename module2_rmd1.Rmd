```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure)
```


## insert tables
```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

## insert equations
$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$


## insert footnotes: 
here is a footnote [^1] and another [^longnote]

here is an inline footnote ^[inline notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: here's one with multiple blocks.
